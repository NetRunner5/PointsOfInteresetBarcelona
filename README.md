# Identification of tourist points of interest in Barcelona

The goal of this project is to identify and cluster tourist points of interest in Barcelona and plot them on a map. To achieve this, we will use Scikit-learn, a popular Python library for machine learning, and the DBSCAN algorithm, which is a density-based clustering algorithm. We will also use a dataset of metadata of pictures of tourist interest points in Barcelona from Flickr.

First, we will pre-process the data to extract relevant features and remove noise. We will then use the DBSCAN algorithm to cluster the data based on their density. The DBSCAN algorithm will help us to identify clusters of tourist points of interest in the city.

Next, we will use matplotlib and smopy to visualize the clusters on a map of Barcelona. To do this, we will use the latitude and longitude information available in the dataset to plot the clusters on a map of the city.

Finally, we will interpret the results and make conclusions about the distribution of tourist points of interest in the city. By analyzing the clusters, we can identify which areas of the city have the highest concentration of tourist points of interest, and gain insights into the distribution of these points.

Overall, this project will provide a valuable tool for tourists and residents of Barcelona who are interested in exploring the city and discovering its many attractions. By visualizing the clusters on a map, we can create an interactive and informative guide that helps visitors plan their itinerary and make the most of their time in this beautiful city.
